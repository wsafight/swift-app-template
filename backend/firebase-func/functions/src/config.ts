//STORE AND EXPORT YOUR API KEYS HERE
//NOTE: It is generally recommended to store API keys in a more secure way, via something like Google Cloud Secret Manager.
//This on the other hand is enough for indie devs or smaller projects when there is no risk of malitious team members leaking the keys.
//Still should be said: DO NOT COMMIT CODE LIKE THIS WITH API KEYS TO PUBLIC REPOS

// NotifKit Keys
export const osAppApiKey = "INSERT_YOUR_ONESIGNAL_API_KEY";
export const osAppID = "INSERT_YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID";

// InAppPurchaseKit Keys
export const rcApiKey = "INSERT_YOUR_REVENUECAT_API_KEY";

// AnalyticsKit Keys
export const postHogAPIKey = "INSERT_YOUR_POSTHOG_API_KEY";
export const postHogHost = "INSERT_YOUR_POSTHOG_HOST";
